# diff: Ship `Kafka*` attribute APIs

## Summary
- Move `Kafka*` attribute APIs from `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` to `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt`.

## Rationale
- Prepare the 1.0.0 stable release: `Kafka*` attribute names are part of the initial public surface.

## Impact
- Public API tracking only (no behavior change).
