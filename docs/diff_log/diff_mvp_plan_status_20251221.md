# diff: Mark `Implementation plan (MVP)` as achieved

## Summary
- Mark `docs/implementation_plan.md` as **achieved** and keep it as an execution record.
- Clarify that Streaming work is tracked by `docs/kafka-context-streaming-spec.md` and `docs/kafka-context-master-plan.md`.

## Motivation
- Avoid ambiguity: the MVP plan is no longer a forward-looking plan.
- Keep streaming discussions out of the MVP scope while still allowing the project to proceed to the next phase.
