# diff: Add placement rules for Flink WITH configuration

## Summary
- Added simple “where to put WITH keys” rules to the English Streaming API wiki page.
- Added a small reference table mapping common WITH keys to the recommended `appsettings.json` locations.

## Motivation
- Reduce configuration friction by standardizing a minimal set of rules for `KsqlDsl:Streaming:Flink:With/Sources/Sinks`.

## Files
- Updated: `docs/wiki/streaming-api.md`
